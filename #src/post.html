                                Hygiene. It’s a very important facet of a lashmakers job.
                                You can have the luxurious salon, the right tools,
                                but if you don't pay attention to hygiene there's no way
                                that you can attract and keep clients. We are dealing
                                with people's eyes and eyelashes,
                                after all! By our experience we have discovered some
                                handy tips and tricks to make sure that your clients’
                                eyelashes are healthy and hygienic.

                                            Salon should look tidy, organized and show off
                                            a high standard of personal hygiene. Put yourself
                                            in your client's shoes. Would you like to walk into a
                                            sloppy salon, or have a lashmaker with dirty
                                            fingernails come near your eyes? Hopefully,
                                            the answer is “NO WAY!

                                            or gaps in their day. Just do a little bit of
                                            housekeeping to pass the time. Keep an eye on glass

                                            work day. These are utilized more often than
                                            any other surface during the day and tend to
                                            show more dirt. If
                                            anything is looking a bit messy, give it a
                                            quick wipe with an antibacterial cloth. It is
                                            also good to
                                            have a container that is operated with a foot
                                            lever so that you can dispose of waste without
                                            touching the lid.

                                            If you've visited Shiakidi Beauty website,
                                            you'd know that this is one of our favorite
                                            sayings and the inspiration behind our Foam Lash Cleanser. This
                                            best-selling product removes any dirt, oil
                                            and make-up residue that build ups on eyelashes, leaving,
                                            them conditioned and clean. By regularly
                                            cleansing their lash extensions with a
                                            specially formulated eyelash cleanser,
                                            your clients will extend their lash
                                            wear and improve the health of their natural eyelashes.
                                            This means you'll get more time to actually
                                            lash during an appointment, rather than spending
                                            ten to fifteen minutes cleaning dirty extensions.
                                            It's a win-win!

                                            Your client has experienced your beautifully clean
                                            salon and is admiring their gorgeous, new, safely
                                            applied lash extensions. Hopefully, this is the time
                                            that a client will ask how to clean and care for their
                                            eyelashes. And if not, it's time to lay some wisdom down
                                            about lash aftercare. It’s important to explain how
                                            aftercare works, and it’s equally key to
                                            educate your clients about exactly why cleansing their
                                            eyelashes is such important. Skin oils, eye makeup,
                                            foundation and everyday grime are caught in your
                                            eyelashes and build up. If you don't wash your eyelashes,
                                            this lash buildup can form a crust which blocks hair
                                            follicles and causes a lot of itching and
                                            just plain discomfort. If left unchecked,
                                            lash grime can even lead to blepharitis, an irritable
                                            inflammation of the lash duct that causes crusty eyelids
                                            and watery eyes. Blepharitis is a chronic
                                            condition and often results in eyelash growth problems.
                                            Every lash lover's worst nightmare! If your
                                            lient spends 2-3 minutes every day cleansing their
                                            eyelashes, all this can be so easily avoided.
